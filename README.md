paper: Antiviral effect of quinone-based inhibitors of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as an strategy to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus

In the present study, we described the inhibitory potential of a group of quinone-based compounds against HsDHODH and then identified the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each fragment.
